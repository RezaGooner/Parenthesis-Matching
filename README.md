## Features

- ✔️ Validates the balance of three types of brackets: `()`, `{}`, and `[]`.
- 🔄 Helps in ensuring syntax correctness for mathematical or logical expressions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RezaGooner/Parenthesis-Matching.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the program to check expressions.
3. Input expressions with brackets to validate their correctness.

## Example

```cpp
// Example expression
{[5 + (3 * 2)]}
```
✅ This expression is valid.
